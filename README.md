# NepTune

For many aspiring producers, beatmakers, and sound designers, creating and sharing audio samples is 
frustratingly fragmented: tools are either too technical, too expensive, or not collaborative. Our 
app aims to solve this by combining basic sound design (upsampling/downsampling without pitch 
distortion, filters, reverb, fade in/out) with a social sharing platform. Users can record audio, 
edit and enrich it with effects, then export as high-quality WAV or a portable project file. With 
community features (subscriptions, stats, favorites), we want to make sample creation both creative 
and social. The core audience is producers, beatmakers, and musicians (personas: a 19-year-old 
hip-hop producer working from his phone in his dorm; a bedroom EDM artist looking for inspiration 
and collaboration). Our insight: sound creation is most powerful when itâ€™s both simple and shareable.
