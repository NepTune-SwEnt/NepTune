# NepTune - A social network for sounds
For many aspiring producers, beatmakers, and sound designers,creating and sharing audio samples is frustratingly fragmented: tools are often too technical, too expensive, or not collaborative. **NepTune** solves this by bringing basic sound design (upsampling/downsampling without pitch distortion, filters, reverb, fade in/out) together with a social network platform.

With **NepTune**, you can:
- **Capture** audio from the world around you.
- **Edit and enrich** it with basic sound design effects.
- **Export** as high-quality WAV or a portable project file.
- **Share** your samples with friends, followers, or the whole community.
- **Discover and search** new sounds, with features like subscriptions, stats and favorites.
